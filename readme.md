# NASA IMAGES 

## General info
This webpage uses an API to access the NASA database and allows user to perform a search for images. 
It also features a different astronomy and space science related image each day, along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer. 
	
## API
JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors. 

```
https://api.nasa.gov

```
https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key=DEMO_KEY
```
NASA Image library:

At least one parameter is required, but all individual parameters are optional. 

Search results will come in the form of Collection+JSON, which contains results and information about how to retrieve more  details about each result. In the example above it will return a colection of objects with title "moon" and and media_type "image".
